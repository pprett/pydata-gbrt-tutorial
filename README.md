PyData 2014: Gradient Boosted Regression Trees in scikit-learn
==============================================================

This repository contains the tutorial material for the
Gradient Boosted Regression Trees in scikit-learn tutorial
at PyData 2014.


Requirements
------------
This tutorial requires scikit-learn 0.14+. I strongly recommend
that you update to the current [master](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) version (to be 0.15) since
it includes a significant speedup for our tree ensembles including
Gradient Boosted Regression Trees. You might get slightly
different results (Cal-housing scores & variable importances) depending
on your version of scikit-learn.
